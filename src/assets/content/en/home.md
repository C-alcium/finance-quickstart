### What is the purpose of this website?

The purpose of finance-quickstart is to provide an overview of financial terms for people looking to start FIRE.
Similarly, you can find FIRE differences in supported languages throughout the rest of this site.
At the moment, the current goal is to cover the base topics in English, and later add other languages.
